# kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of Project: 

### Create an Analysis to examine how different campaigns progressed vis a vis their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges:

### In order to examine the different campaigns I first created a Pivot table that allowed me to count all of the theater outcomes and the months that they launched. I used that Pivot Table to create a line chart that notes which months provide the most successful launches of theater funding.

### Once I had considered the campaigns by launch date, I then created a table to review the plays by Goals. In order to compare I used a range of goal amounts to gather the number of plays that were successful, failed and canceled. Then I used the totals to calculate out the percentages and organized the percentages on a line chart

# kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of Project: 

### Create an Analysis to examine how different campaigns progressed vis a vis their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges:

### In order to examine the different campaigns I first created a Pivot table that allowed me to count all of the theater outcomes and the months that they launched. I used that Pivot Table to create a line chart that notes which months provide the most successful launches of theater funding.
